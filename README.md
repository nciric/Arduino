# Arduino
 
 Arduino projects I work on. Below are details on each one.
 
 ## Air quality
 Using any of PMS 7003, 5003 and 3003 air quality sensors, and formulas and data from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#Indices_by_location) project outputs current/average AQI score to the OLED i2c 128x64 display.
 
 I am using Arduino Nano 33 IoT with Arduino Cloud to create dashboard (free account). Make sure to connect your Nano to the Cloud and get crypto key.
