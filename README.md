# Arduino
 
 Arduino projects I work on. Below are details on each one.
 
 ## Air quality
 Using any of PMS 7003, 5003 and 3003 air quality sensors, and formulas and data from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#Indices_by_location) project outputs current/average AQI score to the 3 digit 7 segment display.
 
 I am using Arduino Nano 33 IoT - future version should have web page and JSON output for remote reading. Another, simpler option is to post to 3rd party sites like Arduino IoT or Thingsboard.io.
